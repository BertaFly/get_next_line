This is a get_next_line project, which was made during studying at 42 school (Unit Factory, Kyiv branch of 42 Ã©cole).

Subjectcontains detailed requirements.
In general, this project is about writing a function that returns a line read from a file. After each call it returns a new line.

As bonus part it has 1 static variable, able to return lines from different files in rigth order and work really fast.

No norm errors. I got 124/125 points.
